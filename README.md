# Creative Coding Art Projects

This repository houses my personal art experiments and pen plotter sketches. Each project explores generative techniques using [vsketch](https://github.com/abey79/vsketch) and Python.

## Overview
- **vsketch & Python**: Scripts are written in Python using the vsketch library to design and render vector sketches.
- **Pen Plotters**: The generated SVGs are intended to be drawn with pen plotters.
- **Projects**: Individual experiments live under directories such as `gen_art`.

## Getting Started
1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and [vsketch](https://github.com/abey79/vsketch).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run a sketch with `vsk run <path to sketch>` or use `python` directly depending on the project.

Feel free to explore, modify, and create your own plots!
